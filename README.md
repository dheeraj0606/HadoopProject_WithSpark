## Example projects for 'BigInsights for Apache Hadoop' on IBM Bluemix

This repository contains example projects for [BigInsights](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/biginsights-for-apache-hadoop). Following the steps below on your client machine, it should take you less than 5 minutes to run any of the example projects against a BigInsights cluster. The projects are tested on [BigInsights on IBM Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/biginsights-for-apache-hadoop) but they should also work for BigInsights on-premise.  Note that all of the examples are community supported.

![Overview Image](./overview.png)

The core idea is that you can run an example project to see it working against your BigInsights cluster. You can then copy the project and adapt it to add your own custom logic.  Think of the example projects as working blueprints.

**IMPORTANT:** Please vote for the following [Data Science Experience](http://datascience.ibm.com/) functionality that will replace this Zeppelin installation with an officially supported integration of notebooks with BigInsights:

- [Integrate BigInsights with DSX](https://datascix.uservoice.com/forums/387207-general/suggestions/16274593-integrate-with-biginsights)
- [Include Zeppelin notebooks on DSX](https://datascix.uservoice.com/forums/387207-general/suggestions/15192399-add-zeppelin-notebooks)

### Pre-requisites

- A client machine (e.g. laptop) connected to the internet
- A BigInsights cluster *([Bluemix](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/BigInsights/index.html) setup instructions, [YouTube](https://youtu.be/t1Nuy_zrL7U) tutorial)*
- Java 8 JDK (not JRE) installed on your client machine *([OS X](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jdk.html#CHDBADCG) / [Linux](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/linux_jdk.html#BJFGGEFG) / [Windows](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/windows_jdk_install.html#CHDEBCCJ) installation instructions)*
- Git application installed on your client machine *([Linux / OS X / Windows](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installation instructions)*

NOTE:
- You do NOT need to install gradle, the gradlew scripts mentioned below will install gradle for you
- Some examples may not work if you connect to the Internet through a non-transparent proxy server
