## Overview

This example shows how to compile a Java Map/Reduce program and programmatically submit it to a BigInsights cluster and wait for the job response.  An example use cases for programmatically running Map/Reduce jobs on the BigInsights cluster is a client application that needs to process data in BigInsights and send the results of processing to a third party application.  Here the client application could be an [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) tool job, a [Microservice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices), or some other custom application. 

This example uses [Apache Oozie](https://oozie.apache.org/) to run and monitor the Map/Reduce job.  Oozie is a workflow scheduler system to manage Apache Hadoop jobs.

BigInsights for Apache Hadoop clusters are secured using [Apache Knox](https://knox.apache.org/).  Apache Knox is a REST API Gateway for interacting with Apache Hadoop clusters.  

This example uses [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) to interact with the REST API. This is useful for developers to understand the REST API so they can emulate the REST calls using their programming language features.

## Developer experience

Developers will gain the most from these examples if they are:

- Comfortable using Windows, OS X or *nix command prompts
- Familiar with compiling and running java applications
- Able to read code written in a high level language such as [Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/)
- Familiar with the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build tool
- Familiar with Map/Reduce concepts
- Familiar with Oozie concepts
- Familiar with the [WebHdfsGroovy Example](../WebHdfsGroovy)

## Example Requirements

- You meet the [pre-requisites](../../README.md#pre-requisites) in the top level [README](../../README.md)
- You have followed the [setup instructions](../../README.md#setup-instructions) in the top level [README](../../README.md)
- You have bash, cURL, grep, perl, and tr unix tools installed.

## Run the example

This example consists of three parts:

- [WordCount.java](./src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/examples/WordCount.java) - Map/Reduce Java code
- [MapReduce.sh](./MapReduce.sh) - Bash script to submit the Map/Reduce job to Oozie
- [build.gradle](./build.gradle) - Gradle script to compile and package the Map/Reduce code and execute the Example.groovy script 

To run the example, open a command prompt window:

   - change into the directory containing this example and run gradle to execute the example
      - `./gradlew Example` (OS X / *nix)
      - `gradlew.bat Example` (Windows)
   - some output from running the command on my machine is shown below 

```bash
biginsight-bluemix-docs $ cd examples/OozieWorkflowMapReduceCurl

BUILD SUCCESSFUL

The output above shows:

- the steps performed by gradle (command names are prefixed by ':' such as :compileJava) 
- the steps performed by the MapReduce.sh script 
- the Map/Reduce output which is the count of the number of times each word is seen in an Apache 2.0 License file
 
## Decomposition Instructions

The examples uses a gradle build file [build.gradle](./build.gradle) when you run `./gradlew` or `gradle.bat`.  The build.gradle does the following:

- compile the Map/Reduce code.  The `apply plugin: 'java'` statement controls this [more info](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html).
- create a Jar file with the compiled Map/Reduce code.  The `jar { ... }` statement controls this [more info](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Jar.html).
- execute the [MapReduce.sh](./MapReduce.sh) script.  The `task('Example' ...)` statement controls this [more info](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.Exec.html)

The [MapReduce.sh](./MapReduce.sh) script performs the following:

- Create an Oozie workflow XML document
- Create an Oozie configuration XML document
- Create a HTTP session on the BigInsights Knox REST API 
- Upload the workflow XML file over WebHDFS
- Upload an Apache 2.0 LICENSE file over WebHDFS
- Upload the jar file (containing the Map/Reduce code) over WebHDFS
- Submit the Oozie workflow job using Knox REST API for Oozie
- Every second, check the status of the Oozie workflow job using Knox REST API for Oozie
- When the Oozie workflow job successfully finishes, download the wordcount output from the Map/Reduce job

All code is well commented and it is suggested that you browse the source code to understand in more detail how they work.
