**Important** this example does not work on Basic clusters.  A defect has been raised with the Bluemix on Cloud IBM engineering team.

## Overview

This example shows how to use WebHCat to submit Hive, MapReduce and Pig jobs to a BigInsights cluster and wait for the job response.  An example use cases for programmatically running Map/Reduce jobs on the BigInsights cluster is a client application that needs to process data in BigInsights and send the results of processing to a third party application.  Here the client application could be an [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) tool job, a [Microservice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices), or some other custom application. 

This example uses [WebHCat](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat) to run and monitor the three types of job: Hive, Map-Reduce and Pig.  

WebHCat, previously known as Templeton is the REST API for HCatalog, a table and storage management layer for Hadoop

BigInsights for Apache Hadoop clusters are secured using [Apache Knox](https://knox.apache.org/).  Apache Knox is a REST API Gateway for interacting with Apache Hadoop clusters.  The Apache Knox project provides a [Java client library](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KNOX/Client+Usage) and this can be used for interacting with the Oozie REST API.  Using a library is usally more productive because the library provides a higher level of abstraction than when working directly with the REST API.

Developers will gain the most from these examples if they are:

- Comfortable using Windows, OS X or *nix command prompts
- Familiar with compiling and running java applications
- Able to read code written in a high level language such as [Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/)
- Familiar with the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build tool

## Example Requirements

You have met the [pre-requisites](../../README.md#pre-requisites) and have followed the [setup instructions](../../README.md#setup-instructions) in the top level [README](../../README.md)

For Sqoop example, make sure to specify following in your connection.properties file:
```
dashdb_sqoop_url:jdbc:db2://changeme:changeme/BLUDB:sslConnection=true;
dashdb_sqoop_username:changeme
dashdb_sqoop_password:changeme
```

## Run the example

This example consists of:

- [Hive.groovy](./Hive.groovy) - Groovy script to submit the Hive job via WebHCat
- [MapReduce.groovy](./MapReduce.groovy) - Groovy script to submit the Map/Reduce job via WebHCat
- [Pig.groovy](./Pig.groovy) - Groovy script to submit the Pig job via WebHCat
- [Sqoop.groovy](./Sqoop.groovy) - Groovy script to submit the Sqoop job via WebHCat
- [build.gradle](./build.gradle) - Gradle script to compile and package the Map/Reduce code and execute each groovy script 

To run the examples, open a command prompt window:

   - change into the directory containing this example and run gradle to execute the example
      - `./gradlew Example` (OS X / *nix)
      - `gradlew.bat Example` (Windows)

You can run individual example: 

   - change into the directory containing this example and run gradle to execute the example
      - `./gradlew Hive` (OS X / *nix)
      - `gradlew.bat Hive` (Windows)
   - some output from running the command on my machine is shown below 
   
```bash

## Decomposition Instructions

The examples uses a gradle build file [build.gradle](./build.gradle) when you run `./gradlew` or `gradle.bat`.  The build.gradle does the following:

- compile the Map/Reduce code.  The `apply plugin: 'java'` statement controls this [more info](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html).
- create a Jar file with the compiled Map/Reduce code for MapReduce example.  The `jar { ... }` statement controls this [more info](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Jar.html).
- compile and execute Groovy scripts.

Each example script performs the following steps:

- Create a HTTP session on the BigInsights Knox REST API 
- Upload required query file, jar file and/or data file over WebHDFS
- Submit the job using Knox REST API for WebHCat
- Every second, check the status of the job using Knox REST API for WebHCat
- When the job successfully finishes, check and download the output from the job

All code is well commented and it is suggested that you browse the build.gradle and *.groovy scripts to understand in more detail how they work.
