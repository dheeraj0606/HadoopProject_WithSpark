## Overview

This example shows how to compile a Java Spark program and programmatically submit it to a BigInsights cluster and wait for the Spark job response.  An example use cases for programmatically running Spark jobs on the BigInsights cluster is a client application that needs to process data in BigInsights and send the results of processing to a third party application.  Here the client application could be an [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) tool job, a [Microservice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices), or some other custom application. 

This example uses [Apache Oozie](https://oozie.apache.org/) to run and monitor the job.  Oozie is a workflow scheduler system to manage Apache Hadoop jobs.

BigInsights for Apache Hadoop clusters are secured using [Apache Knox](https://knox.apache.org/).  Apache Knox is a REST API Gateway for interacting with Apache Hadoop clusters.  The Apache Knox project provides a [Java client library](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KNOX/Client+Usage) and this can be used for interacting with the Oozie REST API.  Using a library is usally more productive because the library provides a higher level of abstraction than when working directly with the REST API.

## Developer experience

Developers will gain the most from these examples if they are:

- Comfortable using Windows, OS X or *nix command prompts
- Familiar with compiling and running java applications
- Able to read code written in a high level language such as [Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/)
- Familiar with the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build tool
- Familiar with Spark concepts
- Familiar with Oozie concepts
- Familiar with the [WebHdfsGroovy Example](../WebHdfsGroovy)

## Example Requirements

- You meet the [pre-requisites](../../README.md#pre-requisites) in the top level [README](../../README.md)
- You have performed the [setup instructions](../../README.md#setup-instructions) in the top level [README](../../README.md)

## Run the example

This example consists of three parts:

- [WordCount.java](./src/main/java/org/apache/spark/examples/WordCount.java) - Spark Java code
- [Example.groovy](./Example.groovy) - Groovy script to submit the Map/Reduce job to Oozie
- [build.gradle](./build.gradle) - Gradle script to compile and package the Map/Reduce code and execute the Example.groovy script 

To run the example, open a command prompt window:

   - change into the directory containing this example and run gradle to execute the example
      - `./gradlew Example` (OS X / *nix)
      - `gradlew.bat Example` (Windows)
   - some output from running the command on my machine is shown below 

```bash
BigInsights-on-Apache-Hadoop $ cd examples/OozieWorkflowMapSparkGroovy
BigInsights-on-Apache-Hadoop/examples/OozieWorkflowSparkGroovy $ ./gradlew Example

The output above shows:

- the steps performed by gradle (command names are prefixed by ':' such as :compileJava) 
- the steps performed by the Example.groovy script (output is prefixed by '[Example.groovy]')
- the Spark output which is the count of the number of times each word is seen in an Apache 2.0 License file
 
## Decomposition Instructions

The examples uses a gradle build file [build.gradle](./build.gradle) when you run `./gradlew` or `gradle.bat`.  The build.gradle does the following:

- compile the Java Spark code.  The `apply plugin: 'java'` statement controls this [more info](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html).
- create a Jar file with the compiled Map/Reduce code.  The `jar { ... }` statement controls this [more info](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Jar.html).
- compile and execute the [Example.groovy](./Example.groovy) script.  The `task('OozieMapReduce' ...)` statement controls this [more info](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.JavaExec.html)

The [Example.groovy](./Example.groovy) script performs the following:

- Create an Oozie workflow XML document
- Create an Oozie configuration XML document
- Create a HTTP session on the BigInsights Knox REST API 
- Upload the workflow XML file over WebHDFS
- Upload an Apache 2.0 LICENSE file over WebHDFS
- Upload the jar file (containing the Java Spark code) over WebHDFS
- Download the spark-assembly jar file over WebHdfs
- Upload the spark-assembly jar file over WebHDFS to the job lib directory
- Submit the Oozie workflow job using Knox REST API for Oozie
- Every second, check the status of the Oozie workflow job using Knox REST API for Oozie
- When the Oozie workflow job successfully finishes, download the wordcount output from the Java Spark job

All code is well commented and it is suggested that you browse the build.gradle and *.groovy scripts to understand in more detail how they work.
